    <p>I'm a loving father, veteran, and self taught software developer. Currently certified as an AWS Cloud
      Practitioner and I've been working with the AWS (Amazon Web Services) platform of over a year now and I recognize
      how that platform can be used to help facilitate the growth of any businesses online presence. As of today I've
      built over 30 client websites on the internet for businesses in different fields including local barbershops to
      non-profit organizations. </p>
